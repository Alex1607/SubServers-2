# SubServers 2 [BETA]
SubServers 2 is a rewrite of SubServers, the Server Management Plugin.

## Notable Improvements (Over SubServers v1)
* Hosts (and Host Driver API)
* SubData Direct (and API)
* Names arn't case sensitive
* The Proxy hosts the Servers (instead of the Servers hosting the Proxy)
* Just about everything your players will see either looks like BungeeCord or is Customizable

## How to install/update the Beta Releases
1. Download BungeeCord ([Link](https://www.spigotmc.org/link-forums/bungeecord.28/))
2. Download your favorite commit of SubServers.Bungee ([Click Here](https://github.com/ME1312/SubServers-2/tree/master/Artifacts) for the latest commit)
3. Put them both in a folder together. It should now look like this:

4. If you are updating, make sure to update the files in `~/SubServers`, they wont reset themselves.
5. You can now launch SubServers via your terminal: `java -jar SubServers.Bungee.jar`
